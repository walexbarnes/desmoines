This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Story Point One 
### Citi Bikes are very popular in NYC, used 2,344,224 times and used all the city.

## Story Point Two
### What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

## Story Point Three
### But how many Des Moines does it take to add up to one NYC?

## Story Point Four
### According to population data, Manhattan is 7.51 times larger than Des Moines.

## Story Point Five
### So, to figure out how many rides per month in Des Moines, we need to divide the number of rides in NYC by the population size multiple.

## Story Point Six
### Once we do that, we figure that there will be 312,121 rides in Des Moines per month.
